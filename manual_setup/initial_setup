 1. Vagrant plugins
   Execute below command in your computer to install hostmanager plugin
   
   $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager

2. Clean vagrant environment of any running VM

   Check if there are any running vm
   
   $ vagrant global-status
   
   If there is any, go to the directory and run 
   
   $ vagrant destroy [name|id]
  
   $ vagrant global-status --prune

3. Create a directory for the project:
   $ mkdir manual_setup
   
   Change into the directory
   $ cd manual_setup

4. Initialize the Vagrant environment:
   
   $ vagrant init
   
   This will create a `Vagrantfile` in your directory.

   The `Vagrantfile` defines the configuration for your VMs, including base boxes, network configuration, and provisioning settings.

5. Edit the Vagrantfile to define five virtual machines: one for the Web tier, one for the App tier, and three for the Database tier comprising of MYSQL, Memcached and Rabbit MQ

   An example of the Vagrantfile is in the manual_setup folder

6. Launch the VMs
   
   $ vagrant up

7. Provision the services on each VM by ssh into them and run the appropriate commands from the terminals.
